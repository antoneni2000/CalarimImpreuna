# Calarim Impreuna (Riding Together)
This project was developed within FSEGA as part of the Software Testing course. The main goal of the project was to create a multilingual web platform designed for scheduling horseback riding sessions, providing a seamless localized experience in Romanian, English and French. 
After succesufully developing  the website, the subsequent and equally important phase was rigorous software testing. The testing effort was structed to verify that all functionalities were correctly imlemented, reliable, and user-friendly. This included validating core features such as user authentification, role-based access management, booking appointments and content localization.
The test plan encompassed various testing types, including functional testing, localization testing, cross-browser compatibility, security testing, end-to-end workflow verification, and specification adherence. The objective was to ensure that the platform operates flawlessly under normal and edge-case scenarios across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and languages.
Kay testing activities included:
- **Functinal Testing**:Verifying that all functionalities like user registration, login, appointment booking, and account management worked as expected, including handling invalid inputs and error conditions.

- **Localization Testing**: Ensuring that the entire user interface, messages, and workflows adapted perfectly to the selected language, without missing translations or inconsistencies.

- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Confirming consistent performance and appearance on different browsers and platforms.

- **Security Testing**: Validating role-based access controls and preventing unauthorized data access.

- **End-to-End Integration Testing**: Executing complete user workflows from account creation through booking and managing appointments, validating both data integrity and user feedback.

Throughout the testing process, detailed test cases and scenarios were executed, with results systematically documented in summary reports and bug tracking systems. This helped identify and resolve issues promptly, guaranteeing a stable and efficient application ready for deployment.

Overall, this project not only resulted in a fully functional web application but also provided invaluable hands-on experience in software testing methodologies, emphasizing the critical role testing plays in delivering high-quality software products.
